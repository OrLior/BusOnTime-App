#### BusOnTime project is a POC for Israel's public transport performance rating using public data analysis. Using both Scheduled data (Called GTFS) and past real-time GPS locations for buses (Called SIRI), we created the platform for analyzing all trips performance and publishing it to the users via rest API and a web app UI.
